# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Industrial-Machines-using-ANN
A predictive maintenance project using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to forecast machine failures based on sensor and operational data. Built with Python and TensorFlow/Keras, this project applies data preprocessing, analysis, and model evaluation for real-world industrial reliability improvement.
